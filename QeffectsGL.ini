[Generic]
RenderFrame=-1 	
The most important command, selects an internal marker when QeffectsGL's effects should be applied; set to -1 to apply and the very end of the frame, this works almost always, but the effects will also be applied to the HUD and stuff. Try to experiment with values 0, 1, 2, 3... to find a proper injection point. However sometimes this is not possible and/or stable, so -1 is your final choice.
Anisotropy=8	
Anisotropic texture filtering, set to zero to use game settings. Some old games don't support anisotropic filtering, so the default is 8.
Multisample=4 	
MSAA anti-aliasing. Some old games don't support MSAA, so the default is 4.
Bloom=1 	
Enable bloom effect.
BloomSteps=8 	
Number of bloom blurring passes. Higher values look better but are slower.
BloomDarken=3 	
How much the source scene is darkened before bloom blurring. Brigher games require higher values to reduce blooming on regular stuff.
BloomScale=1.5 	
Final bloom effect scale. Reduce this value if everything looks too bright.
SSAO=1 	
Enable screen-space ambient occlusion effect.
SSAOScale=8.0 	
SSAO effect scale, higher values produce more noticable occlusion effects.
SSAOMinZ=0.005 	
Minimum scene depth to apply SSAO effect. Can be tweaked to remove SSAO on first-person guns, etc.
SSAOMaxZ=1.0 	
Maximum scene depth to apply SSAO effect. Can be tweaked to remove SSAO on far objects, e.g. sky.
Hue=0 	
HSL color correction: hue. Same as in Adobe Photoshop.
Saturation=0 	
HSL color correction: saturation. Same as in Adobe Photoshop.
Lightness=0 	
HSL color correction: lightness. Same as in Adobe Photoshop.
Emboss=1 	
Enable screen-space emboss bump-mapping effect.
EmbossScale=0.5
Emboss effect scale; higher values produce darker emboss effect.
DOF=1
Enable depth-of-field effect.
DOFSpeed=1.0 	
Speed at which focus will be approached.
DOFScale=2.0 	
DOF effect scale; higher values make background not in focus more blurred.
Vignette=0 	
Enable vignette effect (screen is darker at corners).
VignetteScale=1.25 	
Vignette scale, 0.0-2.0; higher values make corners darker.
ExtensionLimit=0 	
0 means no limit; if you set it to say 4000, only those extensions that not totally exceed 4000 characters will be reported to the game; the exception is WGL_EXT_swap_control which is always reported (unless limit is less that its length).
ZTrickFix=0 	
Some old games use a so-called z-trick to eliminate depth buffer clearing; QeffectsGL is not compatible with z-trick. If you suspect the game uses it, set this to 1, and QeffectsGL will attempt to get rid of the z-trick behavoir.
ViewportFix=0 	
Some games (e.g. GLQuake) don't render to the full screen, and don't like QeffectsGL to maximize the viewport when applying effects. Set this to 1, and QeffectsGL will use the viewport at the injection point unmodified.
CompareMode=0 	
Set to 1 if you want to compare the scene with and without QeffectsGL; this turns QeffectsGL on and off every second. Not for a playable releases!
